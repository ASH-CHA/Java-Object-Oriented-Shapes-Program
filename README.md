# Java-Object-Oriented-Shapes-Program
The Java Object-Oriented Shapes Program is a command-line application that allows users to construct various 2D and 3D geometric shapes and calculate their area or volume. The program uses a menu-driven interface and applies object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
